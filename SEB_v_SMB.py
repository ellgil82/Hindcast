''' Script for calculating the effect of modelled monthly mean surface energy fluxes on the surface mass balance.

Inputs and pre-requisites:

	- netCDF files including monthly mean time series of individual variables over the same time period.

Author: Ella Gilbert, 2019. '''

# Load in monthly mean variables
# load in from monthly_mean file.nc


# Calculate seasonal means

# Display statistics

# Plot time series

# Compare variables
# Calculate correlations between e.g. cloud and SMB

#questions: 
# - connection between QCL/LWdown - sim 2nd results chapter (liq = LWdown)
# - connection betwen cloud cover/ SWdown - more cloud, less sun
# - connection: SW vs melt (seasonal/monthly)
# - connection: LW vs melt (seasonal/monthly)
# - when is melt more likely to happen? when there is lots of SWdown, or when liquid-bearing clouds are present to increase LWdown?
# - how much does melt affect overall SMB?
